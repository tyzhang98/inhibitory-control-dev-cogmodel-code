## Abstract

This study examined inhibitory control development in two samples of Chinese children: a primary sample (n = 1,122; 45.5% female; 91.9% Han, Mage = 12.42 years, range: 6.0–18.7) with 6-month longitudinal follow-up and an independent replication sample (n = 1,026; 45.1% female; 90.8% Han, Mage = 12.44 years, range: 6.1–18.8). Generalized Additive Models applied to Stroop and Go/No-Go tasks revealed four-phase nonlinear developmental trajectories. Response inhibition stabilized by 13.4 years, while interference inhibition developed until 15.8 years. Hierarchical drift diffusion modeling showed that interference inhibition developed through enhanced information accumulation (drift rate), whereas response inhibition developed through enhanced response bias control (starting point). Age-related processing speed improvements suggest shared foundational mechanisms. The findings contribute to a decision-computational framework.
